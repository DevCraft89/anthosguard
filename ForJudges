🛡️ AnthosGuard – AI-Powered Fraud Detection on GKE

AnthosGuard is a cloud-native demo system that simulates account creation events and runs them through an AI-powered fraud detector.
It is fully containerized, deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE Autopilot), and exposes endpoints for both publishing events and viewing fraud scores.

⸻

🚀 Architecture
	•	account-created → Publishes account_created events (via FastAPI).
	•	fraud-detector → Subscribes, scores events (LOW / MED / HIGH risk).
	•	NATS / PubSub → Event pipeline between services.
	•	Ingress + LoadBalancer → Public endpoints for demo and testing.

Endpoints

Account Service : /accounts (POST), to publish new account events
Fraud Detector: /healthz, Liveness probe
Fraud Detector: /status, JSON fraud stats (counters + history)
Fraud Detector: /dashboard, Web dashboard of recent scored events
